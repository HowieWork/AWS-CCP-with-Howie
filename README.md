## How I passed AWS Cloud Practitioner within 3 weeks

## Breif

I am a web developer with around 2 year experience. Completely newbie on cloud computing. I started to prepare for AWS CCP early October. And I took the exam on October 28th. Passed on the first attempt with a score of 838/1000.

## Story

### Background

A bit background, I am a self-taught programmer. Has been practicing programming, web development focused, since early 2021. Before preparing for AWS exam, my experience with Cloud Computing is only limited to deploy server/virtual machine. One of my projects needs to use Google Cloud Platform \*GCP. In a nutshell, I have profound understanding of general IT and How Internet works, e.g. client-server model. Other than that, I am a 100% newbie about AWS.

Cloud Computing is popular nowadays and it has been always in my to-do-list. Later September I noticed Amazon has Cloud Practitioner Challenge and there is a 50% discount exam voucher if you are willing to take the exam before end of 2022. I can't find any excuse NOT taking the exam. [So I accepted this challenge and here is my tweet](https://twitter.com/howiework/status/1573303276006969344).

### Preparing

I started to prepare for exam early October. I have about four hours every weekday and the last week, I tried used any time gap I could have to do mockup exams. A profound understanding of general IT is highly recommended. And Amazon provides an excellent BEGINNER-FRIENDLY course [AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials](https://aws.amazon.com/training/digital/aws-cloud-practitioner-essentials/). I really enjoyed this course and reviewed twice. They used a fantastic metaphor - a coffee shop, to connect different knowledge together. And it is FREE for everyone.

Then I followed Stephane Maarek's two Udemy courses: [Ultimate AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner - 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-new/) & [6 Practice Exams](https://www.udemy.com/course/practice-exams-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/). You don't have to pay for such course. There is a bunch free material online and you can start from there. Because my goal is to pass the exam before the end of October. I simple save some research time and go with the most popular course on Udemy. Anyway, you need some practice exams to help you actively recall knowledge you learned. I hate to admit AWS CCP requires a lot of memorization and a lot of knowledge are trivia and you can easily forget half of it the next day if you don't do a good job on review.

I find mockups are really helpful. It helps you to increase your knowledge retention. There is a technique called Active Recall. I found [this Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDbxPVn02VU) explained really well. And I am still arranging my AWS notes. I tried to write down keywords for each section and create my own "Knowledge AWS Tree". So I can quickly review what I learnt. Also, it is good for future reference.

### Schedule

About schedule, first two weeks is about study. Again the two courses I mentioned above. Week three is all about intense mockups and quickly target your weakness - stuff you misunderstood or mess up. For example, difference among CloudTrail, Cloud Config, CloudWatch. Also, details has been included on [Roadmap](#roadmap) section.

### Exam Day

It was week three. I scheduled the exam right after I finished the fourth mockup exam. And at that time, all my first attempts, I failed one and passed three, average percentage is around 75%. And I feel more and more confident so I decide to take the exam. During the exam, please use the 30 minutes before your scheduled time if you take exam at home. No external monitor is allowed. And please prepare enough time to download official exam browser and turn off other applications. Also there is a \*REAL person help/watch you the whole time.

Remember to flag questions you are not sure. And if you got time left, please review your answers.
